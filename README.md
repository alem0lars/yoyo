# YoYo Official Website

This is the source code of YoYo Official Website.

Following Secure-by-Design principle, the website has been made completely static.
This also means you can read the entire source of the website, of course we do NOT believe in Security-through-Obscurity.
The server-side attack surface should be only limited to the webserver exposing the assets, which is btw hosted by Github.
The client-side attack surface should be none, hence it doesn't accept any user input/parameter.

However, if you find any code vulnerability, contact us at info@YoYo.it for a reward and a job offering :)

## Development

Development details are in the [docs](./docs) folder.

## Thanks

We'd like to thank all of the open source projects this website is made with.
