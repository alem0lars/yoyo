  This is the YoYo Official Website.

  Following Secure-by-Design principle, the website has been made completely static.
  This also means you can read the entire source of the website, of course we do NOT believe in Security-through-Obscurity.
  The server-side attack surface should be only limited to the webserver exposing the assets, which is btw hosted by Github.
  The client-side attack surface should be none, hence it doesn't accept any user input/parameter.

  However, if you find any code vulnerability, contact us at info@yoyo.it for a ‚Ç¨-reward and a job offering :)
